# Arabic-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Based-On-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Architectures
This project is a classifier for Arabic Handwritten digits, using CNN architectures (GoogLeNet, LeNet-5, AlexNet and VGG) 
Datasets were used are:
* ADBase 
* MADBase


Datasets could be downloaded from http://datacenter.aucegypt.edu/shazeem/


GoogleNet, AlexNet and VGG models were built based on archetictres described in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iWhJiMT9pgWqYA_3-iRyvQ1DwlhV3hGdR-pinZiiHfk/edit
